**CoachFromCouch** is a project that is being created as my first try with a full stack, fully functioning app that is theoretically ready for real time deployment. 
This is a project to further develop my Python skills, and have better understanding in other topics like Flask, SQL and some assisting technologies like Jinja2.
A project like this should help me understand  some topics that weren't covered in formal education, like sessions, security, user control etc.

This project is still being developed in my rare free time.
